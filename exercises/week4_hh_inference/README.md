# Simulation-based inference on Hodgkin-Huxley model

This week's tutorial is in the notebook `hh_inference.ipynb`. 

We recommend you run the notebook locally using **conda**. Given your `lsmlsmda` conda env you have been using so far, you probably have to install additional packages `tqdm` (for displaying progress bars) and `pytorch` (for training artificial neural networks):
- `conda install tqdm`
- for pytorch follow instructions here: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

If you have trouble with your local installation during the lecture you can also open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/cne-tum/msne-lsmlsda-2019/blob/master/exercises/week4_hh_inference/hh_inference.ipynb) (requires a Google account), or in [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/cne-tum/msne-lsmlsda-2019/master?filepath=exercises%2Fweek4_hh_inference%2Fhh_inference.ipynb).
