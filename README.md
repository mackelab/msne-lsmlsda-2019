# LSMLSDA exercises and mini-projects
This repository belongs to the Large Scale Modelling and Large Scale Data Analysis course at TUM: [moodle link](https://www.moodle.tum.de/course/view.php?id=48594).

## General

## Usage
You find exercises in the `exercises` folder, and mini-projects in the
`mini-projects` folder.

When adding code to this repository, please push it
exclusively to the `your-code` folder: create a folder with
your group name, e.g., `group1`, in the `your-code` folder and work exclusively in this folder.

## Setup
We recommend to use conda environments for managing your Python packages. To
create a conda environment named `lsmlsda` execute

`conda create --name lsmlsda python=3.5.6`

Activate your newly create conda env with `source activate lsmlsda`. Then install additional packages with

`conda install -c anaconda notebook numpy scipy matplotlib`.
